Record Stash! 

This is kind of a catolog for storing record colletion info:
Artist's name, the album, the year is was released. 
It is stored in Firebase(by Google). The user need a Google Firebase account(the free version is fine) 
and the fields will be automatically created when he/she creates the app.
Here is the basic start point for setting up a Firebase app.
https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup?authuser=0

NOTE: If you all ready have a Google acccount / Email you should be able signed into all of Google, including the Firebase site.

Features I'd like to add to this project include:
A field for the user to choose an email address to send a copy (text, JSON, CSV, etc)of the data stored to.

Thanks for trying this software,

Scott George
